## Preface

The summer of 2023, I took 9 classes and tested out of 2 more for a total of 29 credit hours (about an entire years worth of classes) so I could double major in mathematics and do the integrated CS Masters degree program and still have time to take both pure AND applied math classes. I wrote this essay for a core requirement rhetoric class I had to get out of the way and thought it was decent. I enjoy classes that requires me to write my opinion and get it across in a provoking yet civilized way.

I have very strong feelings about the topic. As a kid from the middle of nowhere, the only reason why I made it into the schools I did was because of standardized testing. There were nil opportunities available to me growing up. All I had was determination to make something of myself and access to the internet and made the best of that.

In a lot of ways, The ACT (and SAT) are similar to Leetcode. Some people are just innately good at it, some people aren't, but anyone that spends time doing it can get good. I was in the latter camp. I took maybe close to 15-20 practice tests and spent many hours researching test taking strategies and tips because I was hungry leave my town for somewhere flushed with opportunity. It was just a matter of reps. Anyone can do it, and I put in my fair share of effort to get where I wanted to go.

What angers me is that the most meritocratic heuristic for college admissions is getting ripped away. What I find most horrifying is that it is the name of equality. The difference of what resources a poor student and an affluent student has acccess to is essentailly nothing. Everything is free online, it is just a matter of determination, how long you're willing to stay in the ring. Standardized testing was the only thing that I had that allowed me to say *"See? I can score as high as any of the best and brightest. I put in the work, this is my proof"*. Without that opportunity, I had nothing to distinguish me from the other millions of students that apply to college each year. They are stripping opportunity from those who lack it the most in the name of equality. Those with power and good intentions are capable of the greatest of evils because they can commit harmful actions upon the world with a clean conscious, oblivious to the damage they might cause. 

# Upholding the SAT: A Call for Equality, Not Abolishment

By Nathan Barry

The Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT), a standardized test that forms a fundamental part of the college admission process, has recently been targeted by critics. These critics maintain that the SAT fosters an unequal landscape for disadvantaged students, arguing for its abolition. However, amid this heated discussion, we must recognize the irreplaceable role standardized tests play in our educational system. The goal should be not to do away with the SAT, but rather to strive for a more encompassing solution: ensuring equal access to SAT preparation and resources for every student.

Understanding the importance of keeping the SAT requires an examination of the facts. To begin with, it is undeniable that minority groups and students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds tend to score lower on the SAT. This disparity, however, is not unique to this standardized test. Achievement gaps along racial and socio-economic lines exist across various academic metrics, from reading comprehension to math proficiency. Therefore, eliminating the SAT is unlikely to make these systemic issues disappear. Rather, it would shroud them in a cloak of ignorance.

Secondly, standardized tests such as the SAT provide a common benchmark that enables a comprehensive comparison of students from diverse regions and school districts. It counterbalances grade inflation, an increasing concern in American education where 47% of high school students graduated with an A average in 2016, up from 39% in 1998.

The crux of the problem lies not in the existence of the SAT but in the unequal distribution of resources and preparation materials for this important test. Affluent students often have access to expensive SAT prep courses and tutors that many low-income families simply cannot afford. So what can we do to ensure a level playing field?

When it comes to college admissions, having a standardized ruler stick for comparing students is essential to avoid arbitrariness in the process. Every school and town operates on different standards. The academic rigor and grading system that a low-income urban school adheres to may be drastically different from a high-income placement school.

For instance, an all-A student from an unspectacular high school might be overlooked compared to an all-A student from a renowned institution like the Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology. Without standardized testing, grades from different schools may mean entirely different things. An A at one school might not reflect the same level of achievement as an A from another.

Comparing students objectively through a standardized test actually levels the playing field in a way that benefits more than just the affluent and privileged. Without the data provided by standardized tests, colleges may resort to more biased heuristics in their admissions process. Standardized tests, when paired with equal access to preparation resources, ensure that every student's merit is evaluated on a consistent and fair scale.

Extracurricular activities are often touted as a way for students to distinguish themselves in the college admissions process. However, relying on extracurriculars as a primary metric in admissions can further deepen the divide between wealthy and lower-income students.

A family with significant financial resources can afford to provide their children with expensive extracurricular opportunities, whether it's private music lessons, elite sports teams, or international travel for volunteer work. These opportunities can make a student's application stand out but are often out of reach for lower-income families.

In contrast, the SAT, when prepared for correctly, offers a more equitable metric. While it's true that money can buy many things, it cannot necessarily buy a good SAT score. The experience of a student self-studying for the SAT with free resources is not drastically different from a student paying hundreds of dollars for SAT mentorship. There is a plethora of free tests, textbooks, and instructional videos available online for those who seek them.

The difference in opportunities for extracurricular activities between an affluent urban student and a lower-income student can be worlds apart. By emphasizing standardized tests like the SAT, along with equal access to preparation resources, the college admissions process can ensure a more fair evaluation of a student's true potential. Shifting the focus away from costly extracurricular activities and towards more accessible and standardized measures of academic achievement is an essential step towards a more equitable education system.

Our course of action should focus on increasing access to SAT preparation resources, specifically for disadvantaged students. We should mandate that all high schools provide comprehensive SAT guidance, including when and how to register for the test, the importance of the test for college admissions, and most importantly, how to effectively study for it. 

Additionally, we need to work towards making SAT prep courses and materials accessible and affordable for all students. This can be achieved through public funding or by partnering with organizations that already provide free or low-cost prep materials. A similar model has proven successful in states like Idaho, where the SAT School Day program offered free SAT testing during school hours, leading to increased participation rates from low-income students.

Addressing potential criticisms, some may argue that this plan could overload schools that are already struggling with limited resources. This plan should cost next to nothing to implement. There are many free online test prep websites online. All that it takes is to gather resources and inform others about them. Improved SAT scores can pave the way to colleges and scholarships, steering students towards a trajectory of upward mobility. 

Others may point to the recent trend of some colleges moving towards test-optional admissions, implying the irrelevance of the SAT. However, data show that students who submit their test scores to these schools are more likely to be admitted. This further stresses the importance of ensuring all students have an equal shot at doing well on the SAT.

The SAT isn't a perfect instrument, but it is an invaluable tool in our educational system. Rather than discarding it, let us work towards creating an environment where all students have an equal opportunity to excel. Abolishing the SAT does not promote equality; providing access to the resources necessary to succeed does.
