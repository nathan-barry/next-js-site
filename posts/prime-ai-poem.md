# Kafkhaesque GPT-4

## Prompt:

Write me a poem about AI where each character is used only a prime number of times, and then tell me the number of times each character appeared.

## Output:

In a world of bytes,
Silicon thought,
AI emerged,
To share what's taught.

Minds spun anew,
With circuits keen,
They learn, discern,
In worlds unseen.

Through code weaved,
Neural networks,
Dreams achieved.
