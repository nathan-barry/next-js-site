## Modern Times

It was a culture shock, moving to Austin coming from a small town in Missouri that is only 7% of Austin's size. It made me think about the nature of our contemporary times and all the issues that arise from living around such a dense population center, a relatively new human experience.
Most people today know of Dunbar's number, the fact that humans have traditionally lived in groups sizes of around 150 people. Any larger and then a stable, cohesive group becomes harder to maintain.

It's a paradox that the more people in a location, the higher the alienation the general individual feels. I noticed that in my small town, it was easy to become a "renowned individual". All one had to do was apply themselves. Because of the smaller population, one could almost always become one of the best or near the top in some category. I realized that growing up in a city of a million, the likelihood of any individual becoming renowned for anything was much smaller just because of sheer competition. Also due to the size, in some places, it is harder to form a cohesive model of a community in one's social reality. That's how it feels like at UT. With 50,000 total students, I'll never truly get to know 99% of the student population, which is just sheerly mind-boggling. The paradox of choice also takes place. With a finite amount of energy to spread between who to form relations with, a seemingly endless array of options to choose from can cause one to never fully invest enough in one before moving on to another. 


## Meaning Without Tradition

One of the largest differences that I've noticed between people from a small town vs a large city is the difference of traditional moral values, which changes how they perceive the world and how they orient and conduct themselves in life.

Historically, religion has played an integral part in the human experience and was the lens through which most people perceived the nature of existence. Since the dawn of the age of enlightenment and empiricism, that began to change which eventually led to Nietzche proclaiming one of his most famous quotes, "God is dead and we have killed him."
Nietzche was referring to the fact that empiricism had superseded the role of religion in modern life. The majority of people now view the world from a materialist viewpoint instead of a purely religious viewpoint which changes how man interacts with reality. With the underlying meaning that religion betrothed upon existence now out of the picture, what would happen to man? Nietzche theorized that the future would consist of two types of individuals: the last man, and the superman.

The last man was a man bare of all originality, a person whose creative fire had been quenched and could only consume what others gave it and were incapable of producing. The superman was one who would create their own meaning in an intrinsically meaningless world; a man who would, on a fundamental level, invent the reason of his own existence and orient himself in the world to live for his given underlying reason to live.
The last man is the Huxleian dystopia of humans losing the special essence of humanity: the ability to create and the ability to exist as an individual. When we compare contemporary times to the dystopian predictions of the past, our reality is creeping closer to the realization of Brave New World. It seemed like, just in the book, sexual promiscuity, drug usage, and the overconsumption of mass consumer media continues to become normalized. What is to be realized is that what underlines all forms of hedonism is escapism.

Most people, now living in a reality devoid of the innate meaning that religion gave it, are living in an intrinsically nihilistic world where they lack the ability to create their own meaning. With the lack of ability and insight to create one's own meaning, people naturally trend towards occupying their time with distractions to prevent themselves from contemplating the nature of their reality. Videogames, endless Netflix series, partying, hookup culture, increasingly shorter bits of online media, etc.
The increase of mental illness and the rise of the pursuit of short-term expediency both are prefaced by the lack of meaning that modern man has. Living in an intrinsically nihilistic universe indifferent to your own existence is too much of a burdensome proposition for any human to operate under. One must have a meaning. Whether it manifests in a political ideology or the pedestaling of secularities, one must have a value framework. 


## Freedom For Enslavement

Over time, as man has experienced an increase in liberties, a natural trend with prosperity, an increase in choices has followed. An increase in choices necessitates an increase in responsibility. Unlike technology and prosperity, it appears that wisdom lags behind in the rate of compounding across time. As our world increasingly lacks constraints with an ever-increasing amount of ways to invest our time, it is up to the individual to create constraints that facilitates that time is well invested and not squandered. The ideal life is the life where we have made what we could with the time and resources we have available. Living the ideal life requires becoming our ideal selves who can navigate the complexity of life in a heroic and optimized manner.

Living up to the ideal of the self is a hard and impossible thing to do. Perfection is an elusive goal, but what matters is that one strives for it. In my personal life, I've always gone about making things that I know it best for me as easy and frictionless as possible and made negative things as impractical as possible.

Long ago, I used to spend an unhealthy amount of time on youtube so I prevented my computer from connecting to their server and installed chrome extensions that made it impossible for me to access youtube, to access specific channels and videos with certain keywords, and removed 95% of the UI. For games, I'd uninstall everything after every time I'd play. I removed all unhealthy foods from the home and made it set up habit chains to make doing positive things mindlessly. All this was to curb my natural inclinations.

In a world where one can do anything, one must restrict themselves to truly be free. The richness of life cannot be experienced unless one sets up systems which allows them to optimize for long term fulfiment instead of short term expediencies. 

As Nietzche offered, the one antidote to nihilism is creation, and creation is only the byproduct of a mind with an aim and the will to step forward. Each step reinforces that you're a person that makes progress. That is the self-actualization of man, the convergence towards the ideal. Living up to something larger than yourself: your potential.
