## Humbling Individuals

Sometimes we meet individuals that expand our capacity for awe. Individuals that humble us by their knowledge and competency, how they so gracefully can elaborate on a complex topic or with ease do a difficult task that shows the depth of their competency. One of my heroes has always been John Carmack every video you hear him talk, you can just feel the extent of his knowledge.

It’s a very human feeling, to be humbled by someone else’s presence, and a part of the richness of life is to surround yourself with people that can inspire that feeling within you. One of the great things about going to a large urban city is that I’ve been able to surround myself with great people that inspire me to become more than my current self, the most innate human endeavor.

## Then and Now

I’ve always somewhat optimized for competence. It’s just that now, my understanding of the goal has changed. After working for 8 months, I became a pretty decent software developer. I learned how to work in a professional setting and push production code. I learned how to learn how to build stuff. Something eventually clicked, and after half a year, understanding not just to build stuff, but the underlying model on how to build stuff, eventually became natural and fluid.

I did learn that what I enjoyed above everything else is learning. The greater mission of enlightenment. Being a software engineer tends to be the opposite. By the nature of having a job, you are meant to push features and products in a timely fashion. I enjoyed working the most at the start when everything was something to learn. Work only began to feel like work when much of the conceptual ideas were solved and my only tasks and expectations were to write and test code.

It was then that I truly appreciated what college is. Four years for one to solely focus on learning and have the free time for esoteric pursuits. I felt that if I didn’t become a math expert in college, then it would never happen and I would cap out at a much lower maximum.

## The Beauty Of Understanding

As time has gone on, I’ve gained a growing appreciation for lower-level things. I remember when I first learned how dynamic arrays worked under the hood in Data Structures. I was previously only exposed to Python and JavaScript, and just assumed they “just worked”. It blew my mind to find out that the underlying data structure of the majority of data types are just fixed arrays with different constraints on how to modify them. Learning that a dynamic array is just a fixed array, and to push or pop an element, it creates a newly sized fixed array, copies the relevant data, and the old array is garbage collected, it just blew my mind.

I’ve noticed that the lower level I got when it came to programming, the more I appreciated and enjoyed it. Programming has always been the real-life equivalence to magic. You type these symbols on the screen and then things just happen. Programs are created and executed. Data is modified and extrapolated. APIs are interacted with and things *actually happen.*

Understanding how things work below the hood turns that magic into a science. Things happen *for a reason*. Everything is explainable. Understanding the entire stack of the shoulders of giants we stand on creates an appreciation for the complexity of our interconnected world. Above all, it helps you understand it, and having a true understanding of your work is the most concentrated fulfillment and love the craftsman can bear.

## Finding Time

After listening to hours of John Carmack, Elon Musk, and other rigorously competent people talk, I do think that there is a point where you’re sharp enough, trained enough on how to learn, that learning anything becomes natural. John Carmack just read countless textbooks. So did Elon Musk. Anyone can learn anything now if they can find the time for it.

College will be that time for me. I am going back to truly spend my time maximizing my personal education and will hopefully, by the end of these 3 years, be sharp enough and in a comfortable enough position to just continue to pick up textbooks and further my learning.
