## Life As An Optimization Problem

Most people would describe me as a conscientious, industrious, and *pragmatic* person. Some people treat life as a journey, but I've always lived as if it was a problem to solve. The question that I wrestle with every day is, "How can I do as much as I can with the finite amount of time that I have?" With an ever-increasing amount of opportunities available to me and paths to go down, how can I know which ones can maximize my chances of actualizing my fullest potential? Seeing the world in this light has naturally led me to view and make decisions by first principles.

## What Is Best For Learning?

The school system is a relatively new phenomenon in human history. For most of civilization, man has learned through experience and application. People would work in an occupation starting from an early age or be enrolled in an apprenticeship. Now, people are enrolled in school until the age of 22 before they go out into the real world.

I've personally always learned best through doing and have disdained public schooling. Time was taken away from me creating things to go towards learning theory that I couldn't apply to anything I did and didn't know what exactly that knowledge could apply to but in the most abstract sense. I know that everything that I learn in college is useful, but when? 

## Prioritizing Knowledge

My first semester at university was extremely helpful. Data Structures and Discrete Math shifted the way I thought about code. I do think that this can be considered a secondary knowledge of a sort. What I learned at university is what I think can be categorized as something that enhances one's ability, but doesn't outright grant it. University helps to go from 1 to 10, but it cannot get you from 0 to 1 alone.

I always felt like teaching kids theories that they can't apply and then letting them learn how to apply themselves after the fact has always been putting the cart before the horse. People learn much better when they're engaged and it is significantly harder to be engaged when you don't know why you're learning what you're learning. There's no meaning in the purpose behind it other than to get a degree whose sole purpose is to signify competency.

## Taking A Break From College

After my first semester of university, I took a gap semester to work at a startup. I started at Rubicon Finance, a central limit order book decentralized exchange protocol, and it was great. There I saw what it was like to work on and build an actual large product and gained experience as a software engineer.

My sole goal was to become as competent in all the skills required for me to build a start-up of my own because competency in coding is the most leverageable human skill. No other skill allows an individual to create billions of value by himself. I eventually left Rubicon since I was mainly doing front-end development, something that wasn't helping me progress towards my goal.

My current job checks every box. Solely coding in rust and doing smart contract development. Not only am I learning how to be able to create a protocol myself, but I'm becoming competent in a language that spans many other domains. I have enough free time to learn front-end development to where I now possess the ability to create an entire protocol by myself. Through the nature of my job, I am becoming more competent in finance and I have the flexibility and time to learn whatever is required of me at the moment.

From first principles, taking a gap semester was an obvious move. Worst case scenario, I can cross an explored path off early and be able to focus fully on university. Most likely I'd have made money and learned things over that break. In the best case scenario, it forges a new path more optimal to learning and opens new opportunities.

At the current moment, my sentiment is strongly towards the belief that I am learning much more through working and am becoming competent in the skills that matter much faster than I ever could by going to school. When comparing both routes, where I will be 3 years from now when would graduate and where I would be 3 years from now if I just worked and learned and built the entire time, it's no comparison. Worst case scenario, I can always come back, best case scenario, I'll be already manifesting the uniquely human gift of the ability of creation and providing value to his fellow men.
