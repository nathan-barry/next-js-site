## Drips of Ideas

When I was a sophomore in high school learning about the oppression of the Huguenots in southern France during the 16th century and how it led to “Brain Drain”, an actual term in a textbook we had. Our town was within an hour’s drive from Kansas City, a boom town up on the rise and gaining the spotlight on the national conscious. Even with the short amount of time I spent at high school, I very much noticed the brain drain on our town to an extent where it was hard to get good letters of recommendation. All of my favorite teachers left long before I graduated as if they were disappearing to Galt's Gulch.

My hometown was a small dying midwestern town. It was one where no one can quite put a finger on how they ended up there. 
It was almost as if it was expected of the city. For things such as us having the most fast-food restaurants per capita, the school district embezzling millions and virtually bankrupting itself, and the history of the town as a whole, such things were just expected. It was once one of the most important towns in the country with its influence only set to grow, but due to incompetence, the spotlight moved on. The town has been around for two hundred years and its population has been declining for the last 120 of them.

I was fortunate to have traveled a lot when I was younger so my outlook on the world was much different than most of my peers. I saw the endless metropolis of New York. I saw the cities of culture like Paris and Athens. The great majority of my peers never left the country, and a large majority of that had never left Missouri. The most important thing I noticed was that one's expectations of life are greatly determined by what they've experienced and what they're used to.

Most people's vision of the future was just as grand as the premise of the town. Few of us had any ambition to do something with our lives, having not a clue on what direction to move in and even less about how much is truly possible with the technology available to all of us nor how to take advantage of it. I believe that a large part of who I am today came from my exposure to online personalities such as Lex Fridman, Jordan B Peterson, David Goggins, Jocko Willink, etc. The internet allowed me to gain exposure to individuals who helped form my idea on how to live a proper and ideal life.

## Influences

For the longest time, I had a little square photo of the following on my computer monitor: Jordan B Peterson, Lex Fridman, and David Goggins. Next to them was an 8x10 portrait of Teddy Roosevelt.

It was my sophomore year when I started listening to Jordan B Peterson. It was the first time in my life that made me think “By god, I can and **should** be doing more with my life!” He instilled the idea that what one should do in life is figure out how much one can bear and then bear it. The idea that the way to a meaningful life is to take as much responsibility and accountability as one possibly can and genuinely try to do what we can on this Earth. The idea that not doing so is existentially nihilistic. That with this one beautiful life each of us has, not living up to what one could be, not trying at least, that is spitting in the face of the miracle of existence itself. There is nothing more disappointing than seeing something fall short of its potential. Missed opportunities and an improperly spent life.

Throughout most of my life, I have always acted along one principle. For every decision, I would choose the action that was best for the summation of me averaged across time. As in, I would act in faith to what is best for me not just now, but me one month from now, one year, one decade, and everything between and beyond. This seems to be the essence of conscientiousness and it was from Jordan B Peterson that conscientiousness and the urge to be industrious and make something of my life was engrained in me.

David Goggins occasionally mentions that he works hard because he imagines a life where he didn’t. A life where God, in the end, shows him who he was vs who he could have been. Some overweight miserable guy working a dead-end job killing rats and cockroaches in the back of Chinese restaurants when he could have been who he is today, a renowned endurance athlete and famous author and figure. Nothing seems more painful than that, seeing what one left off the table in the one life they have. Seeing how much more you could have been if only you had a stronger will. A more disciplined mind. A harder work ethic.

I've always enjoyed physical challenges. Years of intense cross-country routines. Months of waking up at 4:30 am and taking freezing showers in the winter. Running a marathon after not running for 5 months. Having the will to push your body until the verge of collapsing is much more tangible than doing the same mentally.

I’ve always admired Lex Fridman. He always seemed like a version close to my ideal self. We both ran, did machine learning and AI, played guitar and piano, lived time-blocked routines, loved Dostoevsky, and had very similar beliefs and views on how to orient oneself and go through life. He was a role model, someone I wished to be like as I grew into who'd I'd become. Growing up in my small hometown, there wasn't anyone interested in what I was interested in. From Lex I could see a faint glimpse into the future: the people who are out there, the people I'll one day be able to be around. Just like how traveling when young broadens the mind to how much more is out there, I was able to look towards the future with hopeful eagerness to a world where I can be around those with the same interests and aspirations. 

Over the years I've grown to be my own person with my own amalgamated values and viewpoints coming from much more experience, reading, and life. While I have left these figures in the past, their impact still runs through my veins.

From one of my favorite figures in history, another archetypal character of "he who manifests into being", I'll leave a quote.
