## The Small Town

The town I came from was not a place of opportunity. It was one of those small declining midwestern towns that no one can quite put a finger on how they ended up there. There was few one could do to rise up in life and there was a limit hard cap on what success could be. Things such as us having the most fast-food restaurants per capita, the school district embezzling millions and virtually bankrupting itself, and the history of the town as a whole. It was once one of the most important towns in the country with its influence only set to grow, but due to incompetence, the spotlight moved on. The town has been around for two hundred years and its population has been declining for the last 120 of them.

When I was a sophomore in high school learning about the oppression of the Huguenots in southern France during the 16th century and how it led to “Brain Drain”, an actual term in a textbook we had. Our town was within an hour’s drive from Kansas City, a boom town up on the rise and gaining the spotlight on the national conscious. Even with the short amount of time I spent at high school, I very much noticed the brain drain on our town to an extent where it was hard to get good letters of recommendation. All of my favorite teachers left long before I graduated as if they were disappearing to Galt's Gulch.

Writing that just made me realize that that's exactly how I felt growing up. My home town was the world of Atlas Shrugged.

Most people were chained by the town. Most people conformed to the town. It was always joked that we were 50 years behind any other town, but it showed in our outlooks on life. Few of us had any desire to do something with our lives, having not a clue on what to even desire to do and a fainter clue on the extent of the possibility of the individual man.

## Influences

For the longest time, I had a little square photo of the following on my computer monitor: Jordan B Peterson, Lex Fridman, David Goggins, and Shivon Zilis. Next to them was a portrait of Teddy Roosevelt

It was my sophomore year when I started listening to Jordan B Peterson. It was the first time in my life that made me think “By god, I can and **should** be doing more with my life!” He instilled the idea that what one should do in life is figure out how much one can bear and then bear it. The idea that the way to a meaningful life is to take as much responsibility and accountability as one possibly can and genuinely try to do what we can on this Earth. The idea that not doing so is existentially nihilistic. That with this one beautiful life each of us have, not living up to what one could be, not trying at least, that is spitting in the face of the miracle of existence itself. There is nothing more disappointing than seeing something fall short of its potential. Missed opportunities and an improperly spent life.

Throughout most of my life, I have always acted along one principle. For every decision, I would choose the action that was best for the summation of me averaged across time. As in, I would act in faith to what is best for me not just now, but me one month from now, one year, one decade, and everything between and beyond. This seems to be the essence of conscientiousness and it was from Jordan B Peterson that conscientiousness and the urge to be industrious and make something of my life was engrained in me.

David Goggins occasionally mentions that he works hard because he imagines a life where he didn’t. A life where God, in the end, shows him who he was vs who he could have been. Some overweight miserable guy working a dead-end job killing rats and cockroaches in the back of Chinese restaurants when he could have been who he is today, a renowned endurance athlete and famous author and figure. Nothing seems more painful than that, seeing what one left off the table in the one life they have. Seeing how much more you could have been if only you had a stronger will. A more disciplined mind. A harder work ethic.

I've always enjoyed physical challenges. Years of intense cross-country routines. Months of waking up at 4:30 am and taking freezing showers in the winter. Running a marathon after not running for 5 months. Having the will to push your body until the verge of collapsing is much more tangible than doing the same mentally.

I’ve always admired Lex Fridman. He always seemed like a version close to my ideal self. We both ran, did machine learning and AI, played guitar and piano, lived time-blocked routines, loved Dostoevsky, and had very similar beliefs and views on how to orient oneself and go through life. He was a role model, someone I wished to be like as I grew into who'd I'd become. 

One might wonder why Shivon Zilis is up there. She’s not a public persona. What is true is that she’s another similar archetypal ideal. She and Lex both are the competent individual enthralled in their own passion to create and add to the world. It is a noble thing to be.

From one of my favorite figures in history, another archetypal character of he who manifests into being, I'll leave a quote.

“Do what you can, with what you have, where you are” - Teddy Roosevelt
